## Appendix 1: Population location prior

A trick is used to derive a prior for the case presented in chapter 4. The idea here is that we want to use the information in the fact that a fly was detected at the centre of the trap. The trick is to model the probability of the first detection being at trap $k$ as the probability that a fly is detected at $k$ in a given period conditional on exactly one fly total being detected in that period. A benefit of this model is that it does not depend on how many weeks it took to get the first detection (which would require information about how long flies have been around before the first detection). 

Suppose we have $K$ traps indexed by $k \in \{1, \ldots, L\}$. Suppose also that we have a prior distribution over the population size $N$, given by $N \sim \mathrm{Geometric} (0.05)$, as in chapter 4. (Here we assume no change in population size over time.) Now, we suppose that each trap $k$ is "competing" to catch the first fly each week. Suppose, for simplicity, that all flies are located at a single random point $L$. Under the prior distribution, we assume that $L$ is distributed uniformly over a $3.2 \times 3.2 ~ \mathrm{km}^2$ trapping grid, with traps spaced evenly at 400 m intervals. Finally, define the random variable
$$
C_k = \begin{cases}1 & \text{a fly is caught in trap } k \text{ before any other trap} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}. \end{cases}
$$

Note that, in chapter 4, letting $\delta$ denote the centre trap, we observe $C_\delta=1$, and $C_k = 0, ~ \forall k \neq \delta$. Under these assumptions, the posterior $L \mid C_k = 1$ is the distribution of $L$, given that a fly was caught in trap $k$ before any other trap. The idea of this method is to infer this posterior distribution, and set it to be our prior distribution for the population location in the main model.

For the example in chapter 4, Gibbs sampling was used to infer the posterior distribution. Under the above assumptions, the distribution of the posterior $L \mid C_\delta = 1$ resembles a bivariate normal distribution with mean $\mathbf 0_2$ and variance $160^2 I_2$.

## Appendix 2: Distance between a bivariate normal random variable and its mean is gamma distributed

Here I prove a claim made in chapter 4. This is the claim that $X \sim \mathrm {Normal}_2 (\pmb \mu, \sigma^2 I_2) \implies \lVert X - \pmb \mu \rVert^2 \sim \Gamma(1, \sigma^2/2)$, where $\Gamma(a, b)$ is the gamma distribution with shape $a$ and scale $b$. 

Let $X \sim \mathrm {Normal}_2 (\pmb \mu, \sigma^2 I_2)$ so that $X_i \sim \mathrm{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)$, $i \in \{1, 2\}$. Also, let $Z_i \sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 1), ~ i \in \{1, 2\}$. Then, 

$$
\begin{aligned}
  Y &= \lVert X - \pmb \mu \rVert^2  \\
    &= (X_1 - \mu_1)^2 + (X_2 - \mu_2)^2 \\
    &= \sigma^2 (Z_1^2 + Z_2^2). \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore, $Y \sim \sigma^2 \chi^2(2)$, by the well known theorem that the sum of $n$ independent standard normal random variables is distributed as $\chi^2(n)$. This distribution is equivalent to $\Gamma(1, 1/2)$, where $\Gamma$ is defined as above. By the scaling property of the gamma distribution, we have $Y \sim \Gamma(1, \sigma^2 / 2)$. 

## Appendix 3: Probability of capture time adjustment

In chapter 4, I explain that we use estimates of the probability of capture over the lifetime of an individual fly. If these were used without correction for weekly capture probabilities, we would overestimate the probability of capturing any given fly. Here, I explain a correction used to adjust the probabilities of capture, when we are interested in the probability of capture over only one week.

Suppose there is just one fly. Let $q$ be the probability that the fly is captured over its lifetime (4 weeks). Assume that each week, the fly is captured with daily capture probability $p$. We have 
$$
\begin{aligned}
  q &= \Pr(\text{fly caught in lifetime}) \\
    &= \Pr(\text{fly caught on week 1, 2, 3, or 4}) \\
    &= 1 - \Pr(\text{fly not caught on week 1, 2, 3, or 4}) \\
    &= 1 - (1 - p)^{4} \\
    \implies p &= 1 - (1-q)^{1/4}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Therefore, the probability that the fly is caught in any given week is $1 - (1 - q)^{1/4}$, where $q$ is the lifetime probability of capture. 

In chapter 4, it is assumed that Medfly lifetimes are four weeks long. Note, however, that we could substitute any proportion for $1/4$. Further, one could define the proportion as a random variable with a prior distribution, if we wish to model uncertainty about fly lifetime lengths.
