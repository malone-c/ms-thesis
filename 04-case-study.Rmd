# Case study: Ceratatis capitata

### Intro: Version 1

In the previous section, a general model for inferring absence/presence of a cryptic, incipient pest species population was introduced. In this chapter, I apply the model to a specific case study. 


## Example case: Medfly

An example case of the kind described above can be seen in Mediterranean fruit fly (C. Capitata). 

### Economic importance of the fruit fly

### Medfly detection problems

Medfly have low dispersal. This means that flies may go undetected across generations.

## [Motivating the model extension] Problems posed by Medfly for the Barnes model

The reader may recall that the model introduced in chapter 3 was motivated by consideration of three restrictive assumptions, listed in chapter 2. These assumptions were...

I will briefly describe why these assumptions do not satisfy.

* Problem 1: Flies live across generations.
* Problem 2: It is hard to estimate a distribution for $p$.

* Problem 3: Growth rate is assumed constant.
