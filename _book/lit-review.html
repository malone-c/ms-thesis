<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>The present work responds to two bodies of literature. Firstly, it responds to the literature on zero-catch criteria for tephritid fruit flies. In particular, I propose a methodology for rigorous, model-based evaluation and revision of zero-catch criteria. Secondly, this work responds to the literature on Bayesian inference of eradication of pest populations in general. Thus far, Bayesian models of pest extirpation have been developed for at least two scenarios. However, tephritid fruit flies raise some unique challenges, which the present work discusses. Further, the question of zero-catch criteria is not broached. In this chapter, I discuss each of these bodies of literature, how they inform the present work, and the problem this work seeks to address. I begin by discussing fruit fly zero-catch criteria, and how they have been analysed in the literature. I then move on to discuss the Bayesian models that inspire the approach I take in chapters 3 and 4.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-catch-criteria" class="section level2" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Zero-catch criteria</h2>
<p>As mentioned in chapter 1, inference of pest absence is typically performed based on rules of thumb, referred to here as <em>zero-catch criteria</em> (following <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-meats2005" role="doc-biblioref">Meats and Clift</a> (<a href="#ref-meats2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>). In some fruit fly exclusion zones that are at high risk of invasion, a network of monitoring traps is laid out year-round. These traps are checked periodically (typically every 7-14 days). These are minimum periods of time over which a fly is not detected. If we do not detect a fly for the specified (temperature-dependent) number of weeks, then we may infer and declare that the incipient population has been eradicated.</p>
<p>The reader may wonder why declaring eradication is considered important. The primary reason is that pest-free area (PFA) status is economically valuable to producers in the relevant region. This is because there may be offshore markets which require that produce is supplied from a PFA for a given pest. Even without such a requirement, PFA status may allow the supplier to receive a price premium for goods sold. As such, PFA status increases the value of goods sold.</p>
<p>Zero-catch criteria vary according to the species and the international market for the relevant produce (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-meats2005" role="doc-biblioref">Meats and Clift</a> (<a href="#ref-meats2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span>). However, it is typical that they are based on the assumed length of a generation. For example, for Mediterranean fruit fly the criterion is 12 weeks, or 4 weeks and 1 generation, whichever is longer. The length of a generation is typically a constant based on the number of “degree days” that pass. Briefly, the degree days associated with a sequence of days of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sum of average temperatures for each day, minus the development threshold for the relevant species. Here, the development threshold is the lowest temperature at which we assume the species is capable of developing.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Degree day methods are simple but ignore important aspects of fly biology such as humidity, host availability, and differential effects of temperature on different life stages of fly – e.g. larvae, adult, etc. (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-collier2017" role="doc-biblioref">Collier and Manoukis</a> (<a href="#ref-collier2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>). Importantly, they are considered to be relatively arbitrary (see <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-meats2005" role="doc-biblioref">Meats and Clift</a> (<a href="#ref-meats2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-collier2017" role="doc-biblioref">Collier and Manoukis</a> (<a href="#ref-collier2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>As is hopefully clear from the discussion so far, zero-catch criteria are relatively informal. They assume, implicitly, that, if we have not detected a population in a certain fixed number of generations, then they must not be present at a sustainable population density. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-meats2005" role="doc-biblioref">Meats and Clift</a> (<a href="#ref-meats2005" role="doc-biblioref">2005</a>)</span> provide point estimates of the probability that the zero-catch criteria “get it wrong” by recommending reinstatement of PFA status when flies are still present at a sustainable level. However, crucial to the authors’ analysis is the assumption that the zero-catch criteria are generally correct. In particular, they assume that the implied acceptable rate of fly detection (under the rule of thumb) corresponds to the lowest viable population density for the fly species in question. The justification given is that the criteria are formulated based on a significant degree of practical experience. However, it is debatable whether it is possible to learn optimal zero-catch criteria by experience. In particular, in the case of Mediterranean fruit fly, there is a long-standing debate about whether spot infestations in California are due to repeated eradications, or instead due to repeated flare-ups of one continuous low-lying population (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-carey2017" role="doc-biblioref">Carey et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-carey2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>). As such, it is unclear whether existing zero-catch criteria should be taken at face value, as these authors do. Further, it is not possible to evaluate criteria using the authors’ method as it is based on the assumption that the zero-catch criteria are correct.</p>
<p>Some attempts have been made to evaluate zero-catch criteria using agent-based models (see, e.g. <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-collier2017" role="doc-biblioref">Collier and Manoukis</a> (<a href="#ref-collier2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>). For this work, I will say that a model is agent-based when properties of individual agents (here, biological individuals) are explicitly represented. For example, we may be concerned with locations or reproduction rates, which we presume to differ between individuals. As such, the definition of an agent-based model is not mathematical, but scientific, as it pertains to the interpretations of mathematical objects. Such studies as that mentioned above involve simulating the time to extirpation of outbreaks in various locations. The idea is to determine the time taken for the pest population to be eradicated under control measures. However, this method does not use information in survey records to inform this process.</p>

<div id="bayesian-models-for-inferring-the-presence-or-absence-of-a-pest-population" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Bayesian models for inferring the presence or absence of a pest population</h2>
<p>The problem of inferring the presence or absence of a difficult-to-detect species has a literature of its own. Models date back to at least the 1990s, using relatively simple and general models to infer pest absence (see <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-boakes2015" role="doc-biblioref">Boakes et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-boakes2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> and <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-caley2014" role="doc-biblioref">Caley and Barry</a> (<a href="#ref-caley2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span> for reviews). Such methods are attractive for their simplicity, generality, and efficiency of computation. Unfortunately, these models make strong assumptions about prior distributions for key model parameters which are not defensible in general. For example, most assume a fixed, and either constant or declining population size (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-caley2015" role="doc-biblioref">Caley et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-caley2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, p. 2). This is not reasonable for the study of invasive species, for which the population growth rates are uncertain, and indeed may be increasing.</p>
<p>Another issue with simpler models is their relative inflexibility with respect to the structure of the model. For example, many models (see, e.g., <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mcardle1990" role="doc-biblioref">McArdle</a> (<a href="#ref-mcardle1990" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-barnes2021" role="doc-biblioref">Barnes et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-barnes2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-boakes2015" role="doc-biblioref">Boakes et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-boakes2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>) assume that we know the probability of detecting a specimen drawn randomly from the population. However, in the case of fruit flies, this quantity is difficult to study empirically. This is because the capture probability is dependent on the spatial layout and types of monitoring traps that are deployed. Spatial density and trap type vary between situations. For example, countries (and states within countries) differ in the types of traps used and the spatial density of traps. As such, while we may be able to learn about the probability of capture <strong>per trap</strong>, it is not possible to learn about the probability that a fly is captured in general.</p>
<p>In contrast, a class of elaborate models for inferring species extinction have recently appeared in the literature on inferring pest extirpation from survey records. In particular, two attempts have recently been made to develop biologically realistic models to infer the probability of eradication from the survey record. These papers inspire the model I develop in the following chapter – although there are also some marked differences, as the reader will see. Here, I will discuss the contributions of each of these papers.</p>
<div id="red-fire-ants" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Red fire ants</h3>
<p>The first instance of a Bayesian model for inferring presence or absence of a pest is given by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-keith2013" role="doc-biblioref">Keith and Spring</a> (<a href="#ref-keith2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>. The authors use an agent-based Bayesian model to infer the distribution of fire ant nests in Brisbane. They obtained data on the locations and month of discovery for <span class="math inline">\(n = 7{,}068\)</span> nests. They also observed whether data were passively or actively discovered (e.g. by members of the public or through a targeted search).</p>
<p>A core aim of this model is to infer the size and spatial distribution of a super-population of ants. Under the prior distribution, the ant super-population spreads through the founding of new colonies (sub-populations). In particular, once each nest matures (after 8 months) it founds a new ant nest with some unknown probability. The authors refer to this founding event as a “jump.” Time series data of discoveries is used to infer parameters such as the number of ant nests, the distribution of “jump” distances, and the probability of founding a new nest. The joint posterior distribution of these parameters is then used to infer the spatial distribution of ant nests across several years.</p>
<p>The model explicitly models the location of each agent (ant nest). As such, the number of parameters in the model is itself unknown. The upshot of this is that typical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, such as standard Metropolis-Hastings sampling, fail. This is because they do not allow the dimension of the parameter vector to vary between draws. As discussed in chapter 4, this is a general problem faced by agent-based Bayesian models. To get around this problem, the authors use a generalisation of reversible jump Markov sampling (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-green1995" role="doc-biblioref">Green</a> (<a href="#ref-green1995" role="doc-biblioref">1995</a>)</span>) known as generalised Gibbs sampling. This gets around the problem by adding a step to the Gibbs sampler in which the Markov chain moves between coordinate spaces.</p>

<div id="red-foxes" class="section level3" number="2.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Red foxes</h3>
<p>The second instance of a Bayesian model for inferring eradication is given by <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-caley2015" role="doc-biblioref">Caley et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-caley2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. Caley and co-authors develop a Bayesian model of fox sightings in Tasmania. Their goal is to infer the posterior probability that foxes had been eradicated, given a record of fox carcass sightings. They obtained data on fox carcass sightings from two sources, namely, hunter kills and road kills. These separate “observation processes” were modelled separately, so that posterior detection rates were allowed to differ between the sighting types. Detection rates were assumed to be constant across time and location for each type of sighting. Notably, uninformative prior distributions were set for detection rates (i.e. the probability of detecting a fox was set to be uniform on <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span>). This was because the fox sighting mechanism has not been studied empirically (indeed, it is not clear how it could be studied at all). Data consisted of a single sighting count for each location (with Tasmania divided geographically into grid cells) and each year between 2001 and 2013. Data were all zeroes except for exactly four unit observations (sightings of exactly one fox).</p>
<p>The authors use a form of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to sample from the posterior. In the simplest case, ABC works by first drawing samples of the parameter vector <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> from the prior distribution <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\theta)\)</span>, then second, drawing simulated data <span class="math inline">\(y_{\text{sim}}\)</span> from the likelihood, then keeping the proposed <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> if and only if <span class="math inline">\(y_{\text{sim}}\)</span> is an approximate match with the observed data. The authors use the sum of the observations over the observation period as the matching statistic. They kept samples only if the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> simulations were an exact match with the data. The justification given for using this method is that the likelihood is not analytically tractable.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Gaps</h2>
<p>Above, I have discussed the two models in the literature for inferring the eradication of an incipient biological invasion. The current work seeks to address two gaps in the literature.</p>
<p>Firstly, Bayesian models have not been explored for inferring eradication of Tephritid fruit flies. Fruit flies pose an interesting case study because the regulator has fine-grained information about the detection system. In particular, the surveillance system is relatively simple. Traps are placed at fixed, known locations, and checked periodically, at regular time intervals. Further, prior research investigating the efficacy (i.e. sensitivity) of these traps exists (see chapter 3). If used carefully, this information can be leveraged through the model’s prior distributions to learn from the zero-sighting record efficiently. Since the authors discussed above used noninformative prior distributions for key parameters, leveraging such information represents the first attempt to use prior literature to set informative prior distributions for such a model.</p>
<p>Complex models have not been developed to study the problem of inferring fruit fly eradication from zero-sighting records. Such models, if developed, could perform a range of useful functions. For example, when used with zero-catch data, such models could be used (a) to evaluate rules of thumb for PFA reinstatement; (b) to rigorously devise new recommendations for PFA reinstatement, that are sensitive to specific features of the outbreak; and (c) to provide the decision-maker with precise probabilistic estimates of the probability of eradication given any particular length of time for which flies were not detected. Further, such models, when used with real surveillance datasets, could also be used to learn about crucial properties of fruit fly species, such as their field population growth rates, and trap capture rates.</p>
<p>The present work builds on the work of <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-lance1994" role="doc-biblioref">Lance and Gates</a> (<a href="#ref-lance1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span>. In that work, the authors first estimate the probability of detection in a single trap, as a function of the distance between trap and fly, based on their own experimental data. Then, they use the estimated curve to derive a point estimate of the probability of capturing one or more flies. This is done under the assumption of a uniform prior distribution for the locations of flies. Under these assumptions, the authors examine the likelihood of zero detections for various population sizes. This allows the authors to estimate how large the population needs to be before it is detected with a high degree of certainty. This work generalised that work in two ways. Firstly, a prior distribution is defined for the population size. This allows us to infer the posterior probability of eradication. Secondly, a more realistic prior is set for fly locations. In real cases, if we suspect the presence of a fly population, we will typically have some information about its whereabouts. I discuss ways for using this information to infer the probability of eradication more efficiently in chapter 3.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>The purpose of this chapter has been to situate the current work with respect to two bodies of literature. On one hand, there is the literature on tephritid fruit flies. While computational models of population dynamics exist, there has been no comprehensive attempt to use statistical modelling to evaluate or propose zero-catch criteria. On the other hand, there is the literature on Bayesian models for inferring eradication of pests. Here, there has not been a model proposed for the case where there exists information on the probability of detection as a function of distance between surveyor and individual. The present work seeks to solve both of these problems simultaneously. I.e. a novel Bayesian model of medfly detections is developed, and applied to the problem of evaluating and proposing zero-catch criteria. In the next chapter. I turn to discuss the model in broad generality. Then, in chapter 4, I apply the model developed in chapter 3 to a case study.</p>
