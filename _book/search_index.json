I begin by discussing the general problem of inferring absence of a cryptic, incipient pest species population. In particular, I emphasise that the problem requires the marriage of separate mathematical modelling cultures; (a) mathematical/ecological modelling, and (b) statistical inference. 3.1 Inferring absence of cryptic pests The primary problem this work is concerned with is to infer the absence of a cryptic pest species. A cryptic species is any species which is hard to detect. One example is snakes, which are small, immobile, camouflaged, and located in inaccessible habitats (Inferring the Absence of a Species: A Case Study of Snakes, Kery 2002). 3.2 The standard approach to inferring absence of a cryptic species The standard approach to this problem is given by McArdle (1990). In this section, I outline the standard existing approach to inferring pest absence. Let \\(N \\in \\mathbb N\\) be the size of the population. Let \\(p \\in [0, 1]\\) be the probability that a species is detected in any given sampling unit. Then, the probability of detecting the species is \\[ \\alpha = \\Pr(X = 0) = 1 - (1 - p)^T. \\] McArdle suggests 3 types of question that could be answered with such a model. 1. 3.3 Probability models 3.4 Barnes et al. 3.5 Intro to Medfly In this section, I motivate further study by introducing the example of the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata). 3.5.1 Economic importance of the fruit fly 3.5.2 Medfly detection problems Medfly have low dispersal. This means that flies may go undetected across generations. https://onlinelibrary-wiley-com.virtual.anu.edu.au/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00415.x 3.5.3 Problems posed by Medfly for the Barnes model Problem 1: Flies don’t die. Problem 2: It is not possible to determine location.

I concluded the chapter by discussing some of the models restricting assumptions, and how they affect the realism of the model. In this chapter I propose to develop a general model that relaxes the restrictive assumptions. In particular, I give a general description of the model, followed by some concrete proposals for model specification (e.g. prior distributions). Because this model is analytically intractable, Monte Carlo sampling is proposed. In particular, I discuss the virtues and vices of applying Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling for this problem. 4.2 Model specification The basic model is composed of (a) a growth model and (b) a detection model. 4.3 Sampling "],["case-study-ceratatis-capitata.html", "Chapter 5 Case study: Ceratatis capitata 5.1 Full model specification 5.2 Citations", " Chapter 5 Case study: Ceratatis capitata 5.0.1 Intro: Version 1 In the previous section, a general model for inferring absence/presence of a cryptic, incipient pest species population was introduced. In this chapter, I apply the model to a specific case study. 5.0.2 Intro: Version 2 In this chapter, I build on the previous chapter by building a model for the specific Medfly case.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
