# Literature review {#lit-review}

## Introduction

The present work responds to two literatures. Firstly, it responds to the literature on zero-catch criteria for tephritid fruit flies. In particular, I propose a methodology for rigorous, model-based evaluation and revision of zero-catch criteria. Secondly, this work responds to the literature on Bayesian inference of eradication of pest populations in general. Thus far, Bayesian models have been developed inferring eradication of at least two species. However, tephritid fruit flies raise some unique challenges, which the present work discusses.

## Zero-catch criteria

As mentioned in the introduction, inference of pest absence is currently performed based on rules of thumb referred to as *zero-catch criteria*. These are minimum periods of time over which a fly is not detected. If we do not detect a fly for the specified (temperature-dependent) number of weeks, then we may infer and declare that the incipient population has been eradicated. These rules of thumb vary according to the species and the international market for the relevant produce (@meats2005). However, it is typical that they are based on the assumed length of a generation. For example, for Mediterranean fruit fly the criterion is 12 weeks, or 4 weeks and 1 generation, whichever is longer. The length of a generation is typically a constant based on the number of "degree days" that pass. The degree days associated with a sequence of days of length $n$ is the sum of average temperatures for each day, minus the development threshold for the relevant species. The development threshold is the lowest temperature at which we assume the species is capable of developing. Degree day methods are simple but ignore important aspects of fly biology such as humidity, host availability, and differential effects of temperature on different lifestages of fly -- e.g. larvae, adult, etc. (@collier2017).

The reader may wonder why declaring eradication is considered important. The primary reason is that pest free area (PFA) status is economically valuable to producers in the relevant region. This is because there may be offshore markets which require that produce is supplied from a PFA for a given pest. Even in lieue of such a requirement, PFA status may allow the supplier to receive a price premium for goods sold. As such, PFA status increases the value of goods sold.

While current zero-catch criteria are informal and not justified by theoretical argument, there has been some attempt to analyse them probabilistically. In particular, @meats2005 provide point estimates of the probability that the zero-catch criteria get it wrong by declaring an outbreak when flies are still present at a sustainable level. However, crucial to the authors' analysis is the assumption that the zero-catch criteria are generally correct. For example, they assume that the implied acceptable rate of fly detection corresponds to the lowest viable population density for the fly species in question. The justiication given is that the criteria are formulated on the basis of decades of experience. However, it is debatable whether it is possible to learn correct zero-catch criteria by experience. In particular, in the case of Mediterranean fruit fly, there is a long-standing debate about whether spot-infestations in California are due to repeated eradications, or instead due to repeated flare-ups of one continuous low-lying population (@carey2017). As such, it is unclear whether existing zero-catch criteria can be taken at face value.

Some attempts have been made to evaluate zero-catch criteria using agent based models (see, e.g. @collier2017). These are complex computational models of fly dynamics. Such studies involve simulating the time to extirpation of outbreaks in various locations. However, these do not utilise the machinery of Bayesian inference to infer a posterior probability of eradication.

## Bayesian models for inferring absence of a pest population

The problem of inferring the presence or absence of a difficult-to-detect species has a literature of its own. Models date back to at least the 1990s, using relatively simple and general models to infer pest absence (see @boakes2015 and @caley2014 for reviews). Such simple methods are attractive for their simplicity, generality, and efficiency of computation. Unfortunately, these models make strong assumptions about priors which are not defensible in general. For example, most assume a fixed, and either constant or declining population size (@caley2015, p. 2). This is not reasonable for the study of invasive species, whose numbers are uncertain, and may be increasing quickly. Many models assume that we can estimate a sighting rate, which is constant as a function of the locations of the individuals.

Another issue with simpler models is their relative inflexibility with respect to the structure of the model. For example, many models (see, e.g., @mcardle, @barnes, @boakes) assume that we know the probability of detecting a specimen drawn randomly from the population. However, in the case of fruit flies, this quantity is difficult to study empirically. This is because the capture probability is highly dependent on the spatial layout and types of monitoring traps. In turn, the layout and type of trap are highly dependent on time and place in which the monitoring is taking place. For example, countries (and states within countries) differ in the types of traps used and the spatial density of traps. As such, while we may be able to learn about the probability of capture **per trap**, it is not possible to learn about the probability that a fly is captured in general.

In contrast, a class of elaborate models for inferring species extinction have recently emerged. In particular, two attempts have recently been made to develop biologically realistic models to infer probability of eradication from the survey record. These papers provide inspiration for the model I develop in the following chapter -- although there are also some marked differences, as the reader will see. Here, I will discuss the contributions of each of these papers.

### Red fire ants

The first instance of an elaborate Bayesian model for inferring pest eradication is given by @keith2013. The authors use an agent-based Bayesian model to infer the distribution of fire ant nests in Brisbane. They obtained data on the locations and month of discovery for $n = 7{,}068$ nests. They also observed whether data were passively or actively discovered (e.g. by members of the public or through a targeted search). 

The model explicitly models the location of each agent (ant nest). Typically, when a Bayesian model is agent based, this means that there is an unknown number of parameters in the model. The upshot of this is that typical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, such as the Metropolis Hastings sampler, fail. This is because they do not allow the dimension of the parameter vector to vary between draws. To get around this problem, a generalised Gibbs sampling algorithm is used. This gets around the problem by adding a step to the Gibbs sampler in which we move between coordinate spaces.

### Red foxes

The second instance of an elaborate Bayesian model for inferring eradication is given by @caley2015. Caley and co-authors develop a Bayesian model of fox sightings in Tasmania. Their goal is to infer the posterior probability that foxes had been eradicated, given a record of fox carcass sightings. They obtained data on fox carcass sightings from two sources, namely hunter kills and road kills. These separate "observation processes" were modelled separately, so that posterior detection rates were allowed to differ between the sighting types. Detection rates were assumed to be constant across time and location for each type of sighting. Notably, uninformative priors were set for detection rates (i.e. the probability of detecting a fox was set to be uniform on $[0, 1]$). This was because the fox sighting mechanism has not been studied empirically (indeed, it is not clear how it could be studied at all). Data consisted of a single sighting count for each location (with Tasmania divided geographically into grid cells) and each year between 2001 and 2013. Data were all zeroes with the exception of exactly four unit observations (sightings of exactly one fox).

The authors use a form of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to sample from the posterior. ABC works by first drawing samples of the parameter vector $\theta$ from the prior distribution $\pi(\theta)$, then second, drawing simulated data $y_{\text{sim}}$ from the likelihood, then keeping the proposed $\theta$ if and only if $y_{\text{sim}}$ is an approximate match with the observed data. The authors use the sum of the observations over the observation period as the matching statistic. They kept samples only if the $y$ simultations were an exact match with the data. 

## Gaps

Above, I have discussed the two elaborate computational models in the literature for inferring eradication of an incipient biological invasion. The current work seeks to address two gaps in the literature. 

Firstly, elaborate Bayesian models have not been explored for inferring eradication of Tephritid fruit flies. Fruit flies pose an interesting case study, because the regulator has fine grained information about the detection system. In particular, the surveillance system is relatively simply. Traps are placed at fixed, known locations, and checked periodically. Further, prior research investigating the efficacy of these traps exists. If used carefully, this information can be leveraged through the model's priors to learn from the zero-sighting record efficiently. Leveraging such information represents the first attempt to use prior literature to set informative priors for such a model.

From the perspective of this literature, fruit flies have a few interesting properties. Firstly, unlike with other species, we have some quantitative understanding of the efficacy of traps, conditional on the distance between trap and individual. Secondly, the structure of the surveillance program can be exploited. The regulator typically knows the locations of each fly. Finally, the intensity of the surveillance program changes in a predictable way. It is typically the case that search intensity changes in a simple way across time. 

### Fruit fly literature gaps

Complex models have not been developed to study the problem of inferring fruit fly eradication from zero-sighting records. Such models, if developed, could perform a range of useful functions. For example, when used with zero-catch data, such models could be used (a) to evaluate rules of thumb for PFA reinstatement; (b) to rigorously devise new recommendations for PFA reinstatement, that are sensitive to specific features of the outbreak; and (c) to provide the decision maker with precise probabilistic estimates of the probability of eradication given any particular length of time for which flies were not detected. Further, such models, when used with real surveillance datasets, could also be used to learn about crucial properties of fruit fly species, such as their field population growth rates, and trap capture rates.

The present work builds on the work of @lg1994. In that work, the authors first estimate the probability of detection in a single trap, as a function of distance between trap and fly, based on their own experimental data. Then, they use the estimated curve to derive a point estimate of the probability of capturing one or more flies. This is done under the assumption of a uniform prior distribution for the locations of flies. Under these assumptions, the authors examine the likelihood of zero detections for various population sizes. This allows the authors to estimate how large the population needs to be before it is detected with a high degree of certainty. This work generalised that work in two ways. Firstly, a prior distribution is defined on the population size. This allows us to infer the posterior probability of eradication. Secondly, a more realistic prior is set for fly locations. In real cases, if we suspect the presence of a fly population, we will typically have some information about its whereabouts. I discuss ways for using this information to infer the probability of eradication more efficiently.
