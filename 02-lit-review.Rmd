## Zero-catch criteria

PFA status is economically valuable to producers in the relevant region. Firstly, there may be offshore markets which require that produce is supplied from a PFA for a given pest. Secondly, in some markets, PFA status may allow the supplier to receive a price premium for goods sold. In other words, PFA status increases the value of local produce on international markets.

Pest eradication is based on rules of thumb, which in turn are based on a combination of theory and experience (i.e. trial and error). Meats and Clift analyse these on the basis that the rules of thumb are correct. I.e., they assume that the implied acceptable rate of fly detection corresponds to the lowest viable population density for the fly species in question. However, it is debatable whether it is possible to learn correct zero-catch criteria by experience. In particular, there is a long-standing debate about whether spot-infestations in California are due to repeated eradications, or instead due to repeated flare-ups of one continuous low-lying population (@cite). As such, it is unclear whether existing zero-catch criteria can be taken at face value.

## Bayesian models for inferring absence of a pest population

The problem of inferring the presence or absence of a difficult-to-detect species has a literature of its own. Models date back to at least the 1990s, using relatively simple and general models to infer pest absence (see @todocite). Such simple methods are attractive for their simplicity, generality, and efficiency of computation. Unfortunately, these models make strong assumptions about priors which are not defensible in general. For example, most assume a fixed, and either constant or declining population size (@caley2015, p. 2). This is not reasonable for the study of invasive species, whose numbers are uncertain, and may be increasing quickly. Many models assume that we can estimate a sighting rate, which is constant as a function of the locations of the individuals.

Another issue with simpler models is their relative inflexibility with respect to the structure of the model. For example, many models (see, e.g., @mcardle, @barnes, @boakes) assume that we know the probability of detecting a specimen drawn randomly from the population. However, in the case of fruit flies, this quantity is difficult to study empirically. This is because the capture probability is highly dependent on the spatial layout and types of monitoring traps. In turn, the layout and type of trap are highly dependent on time and place in which the monitoring is taking place. For example, countries (and states within countries) differ in the types of traps used and the spatial density of traps. As such, while we may be able to learn about the probability of capture **per trap**, it is not possible to learn about the probability that a fly is captured in general.

In contrast, a class of elaborate models for inferring species extinction have recently emerged. In particular, two attempts have recently been made to develop biologically realistic models to infer probability of eradication from the survey record. These papers provide inspiration for the model I develop in the following chapter -- although there are also some marked differences, as the reader will see. Here, I will discuss the contributions of each of these papers.

### Red fire ants

The first instance of an elaborate Bayesian model for inferring pest eradication is given by @keith2013. The authors use an agent-based Bayesian model to infer the distribution of fire ant nests in Brisbane. They obtained data on the locations and month of discovery for $n = 7{,}068$ nests. They also observed whether data were passively or actively discovered (e.g. by members of the public or through a targeted search). 

The model explicitly models the location of each agent (ant nest). Typically, when a Bayesian model is agent based, this means that there is an unknown number of parameters in the model. The upshot of this is that typical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, such as the Metropolis Hastings sampler, fail. This is because they do not allow the dimension of the parameter vector to vary between draws. To get around this problem, a generalised Gibbs sampling algorithm is used. This gets around the problem by adding a step to the Gibbs sampler in which we move between coordinate spaces.

### Red foxes

The second instance of an elaborate Bayesian model for inferring eradication is given by @caley2015. Caley and co-authors develop a Bayesian model of fox sightings in Tasmania. Their goal is to infer the posterior probability that foxes had been eradicated, given a record of fox carcass sightings. They obtained data on fox carcass sightings from two sources, namely hunter kills and road kills. These separate "observation processes" were modelled separately, so that posterior detection rates were allowed to differ between the sighting types. Detection rates were assumed to be constant across time and location for each type of sighting. Notably, uninformative priors were set for detection rates (i.e. the probability of detecting a fox was set to be uniform on $[0, 1]$). This was because the fox sighting mechanism has not been studied empirically (indeed, it is not clear how it could be studied at all). Data consisted of a single sighting count for each location (with Tasmania divided geographically into grid cells) and each year between 2001 and 2013. Data were all zeroes with the exception of exactly four unit observations (sightings of exactly one fox).

The authors use a form of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to sample from the posterior. ABC works by first drawing samples of the parameter vector $\theta$ from the prior distribution $\pi(\theta)$, then second, drawing simulated data $y_{\text{sim}}$ from the likelihood, then keeping the proposed $\theta$ if and only if $y_{\text{sim}}$ is an approximate match with the observed data. The authors use the sum of the observations over the observation period as the matching statistic. They kept samples only if the $y$ simultations were an exact match with the data. 

## Gaps

Above, I have discussed the two elaborate computational models in the literature for inferring eradication of an incipient biological invasion. The current work seeks to address two gaps in the literature. 

Firstly, elaborate Bayesian models have not been explored for inferring eradication of Tephritid fruit flies. Fruit flies pose an interesting case study, because the regulator has fine grained information about the detection system. In particular, the regulator knows the locations of each of the traps. Further, prior research investigating the efficacy of these traps exists. If used carefully, this information can be leveraged through the model's priors to learn from the zero-sighting record efficiently. Leveraging such information would represent the first attempt to use prior literature to set informative priors.

Fruit flies are interesting for a few reasons:

* A body of research exists to understand trap efficacy.
* The surveillance program is predictably structured.
* The intensity of the surveillance program changes in a predictable way.

No model has been developed for the case where prior information exists on the probability of detecting a specimen as a function of distance between the detection site and the specimen.

### Fruit fly literature gaps

Complex models have not been developed to study the problem of inferring fruit fly eradication from. Such models, if developed, could perform a range of useful functions. For example, when used with zero-catch data, such models could be used (a) to evaluate rules of thumb for PFA reinstatement; (b) to rigorously devise new recommendations for PFA reinstatement, that are sensitive to specific features of the outbreak; and (c) to provide the decision maker with precise probabilistic estimates of the probability of eradication given any particular length of time for which flies were not detected. Further, such models, when used with real surveillance datasets, could also be used to learn about crucial properties of fruit fly species, such as their field population growth rates, and trap capture rates.

TODO: Note that this work builds on the work of @lg1994. The authors examine the likelihood of zero detections for various population sizes. This work expands that work by exploring the use of prior distributions on the location and population size. This allows for the use of prior information, and modelling of intensified surveillance (e.g. generalising to scenarios with variable spatial densities of traps).
