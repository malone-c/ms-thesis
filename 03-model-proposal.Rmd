# General framework proposal

## Introduction

## The scenario

In the following, I describe a general probabilistic model of an ecological system. The size, location, and number of captures, for a biological population, are explicitly modelled. It is assumed that the data given are a number of captures (or, alternatively, sightings or detections), and that we wish to infer posterior distributions for the parameters governing size and/or locations. 

## Why make the model spatially explicit?

The value of including a spatial component in the model may be questioned. This is relatively unusual in standard approaches (see, e.g., @mcardle1990). It is typical, instead, to assume that each fly has identical probability of being detected (captured). However, incorporating the spatial component allows us to leverage a useful source of prior information about trap efficacy. There exists a moderately large literature of **release-recapture** studies for various species of fruit fly (@todocite). Release recapture studies give us two kinds of data -- one one hand, we get the total proportion of flies recaptured; on the other hand, we also get the mean proportion of flies captured **per trap**, given distance between that trap and the release point. The first kind of data can be useful when the experimental setting is similar to the real-world setting for which we want to perform inference. This will be approximately the case when the types of traps, their number, and the spacing between them, are the same. However, this will often not be the case. In particular, studies vary significantly in the types and number of traps used. For example, @lance1994 used Jackson traps spaced 1.6 km apart, as is standard in California. Meanwhile, @ms2007 used Lynfield traps, spaced 0.4 m apart, as is standard in Adelaide. Further, we may wish to infer eradication of pest populations in trapping systems that are genuinely novel or untested. For example, after an outbreak has occurred, and eradication measures have been stopped, it is common to set up supplementary trapping units to intensify monitoring and increase the likelihood of detecting flies, conditional on their presence in the area (@supptraps). 

## Structure of the model

At the most basic level, I propose to define a joint distribution over (a) the number of flies in a population, (b) the location of each fly, and (c) whether or not any flies were detected (i.e. caught in traps). Defining notation, at each time point $t$, we must define a joint distribution over (a) the number of flies $N_t$, (b) the $N_t \times 2$ matrix of fly locations $\mathbf L_t$, and (c) an indicator variable $y_t$ which is 1 if any fly was caught at time $t$.^[It is assumed that the frequency of time points $t$ corresponds to the frequency at which surveillance traps are checked.] I.e., the model is in essence a joint distribution $p(\{N_t, \mathbf L_t, y_t\}_{t=1}^T)$. Recall that our goal is to evaluate zero-catch criteria for declaring eradication. Therefore, to evaluate zero-catch criteria, we want to infer $\Pr(N_T = 0 \mid \mathbf \{y_t\}_{t=1}^T = \mathbf 0_T)$, where $T$ is the established zero-catch criteria, based on degree day calculations. Call this quantity **the probability of eradication conditional on no detection**. To derive new zero-catch criteria, we want to find the smallest $T$ such that $\Pr(N_T = 0 \mid \{y_t\}_{t=1}^T = \mathbf 0_T) < 1-\alpha$, for some threshold $\alpha$. Here, $\alpha$ represents our risk tolerance. Call this quantity **the time to eradication**.

A Bayesian framework is assumed for inference. As such, to infer the above quantities, we must specify a joint **prior** distribution over $\{N_t, \mathbf L_t\}$, and a likelihood, i.e. a distribution for $\mathbf y \mid \{N_t, \mathbf L_t\}_{t=1}^T$. Instead of defining a joint prior directly on $\mathbf N = \{N_t\}_{t=1}^T$, I define a prior distribution over the parameters that govern the process by which the population grows or decays over time. As such, an assumed stochastic growth model structures the prior over $\mathbf N$.

### Population size

As mentioned above, a prior distribution must be set for the population size $N_t$ at each time point $t \in \{1, \ldots, T\}$. A natural way to do this is to define a stochastic model of the population's change. Explicitly, I recommend to define a prior over $N_1$ directly. Then, for each $t \in \{1,2, \ldots, T\}$, define a prior on $N_t$, conditional on the previous values $\{N_i\}_{i=1}^{t-1}$, as well as parameters governing the growth. A simple example, which I employ in chapter 4, is the Poisson branching process with exponential growth or decay. This is a model of the form
$$
N_t \mid \{N_{t-1}, R_t\} \sim \operatorname{Poisson}(N_{t-1} \exp \{R_t\}),
$$
where a continuous prior distribution is defined over the $R_t$ terms, which may have support over the whole real line.^[Alternatively, the logistic growth model, with an additional "carrying capacity" parameter, could be used.] This model has the attractive property that, when we condition on $\{R_t\}_{t=1}^T$ but marginalise out $\{N_t\}_{t=1}^{T-1}$, $N_T$ has mean $\mathbb E(N_1) \exp \left\{ \sum_{t=1}^T R_t \right\}$.^[Note, however that $N_T \mid \{R_t\}_{t=1}^T$ is not Poisson distributed, and has variance strictly larger than its mean.] This prior is attractive because the exponential growth model is popular in biology and ecology. Given this, in many cases, it should be relatively simple to set informative prior hyperparameters for the latent variable $R_t$. We might do this through expert elicitation, or through review of the relevant literature, in which population change may already be expressed in terms of growth rates.^[For example, see @papadopoulos2002.]

It may be worth noting that we could choose to factor in covariate information for the growth process. For example, for a given pest species, we might understand the growth of populations over time as a function of weather or rainfall. I do not discuss this possibility further in this thesis. 

It may also be worth noting that there are no a priori assumptions on the population dynamics for the growth model. In principle, it should be simple to "plug in" elaborate growth models. For example, the models of @lux2018 or @manoukis2014 could be used to generate independent random draws from the population of Medfly. In this way, they can structure our prior over the population size. In this case, inference would proceed simple as in the case I outline here. This is outside the scope of this thesis, and I do not explore it further. However, this highlights key benefits of the modelling approach taken here, namely its flexibility and modularity.

### Fly locations

As mentioned previously, I propose to explicitly model the location of each fly. As a consequence, at each time $t$, a prior distribution must be set on each of the $N_t$ flies. Accounting for prior beliefs about the location of each fly introduces substantial complexity to the model. However, this can be simplified significantly, as I hope to demonstrate here. 

Note that, in typical situations, we will not be interested in inferring the posterior distributions of fly locations. As such, this is a nuisance parameter.

I first discuss the option of setting a uniform prior. Setting an uninformative prior is fairly straightforward for this problem. In particular, we might assume that, beyond a certain distance from the outbreak centre (say, 1km) any existing population of Medfly is distinct from the population of interest. Therefore, we might set the prior distribution for the population location to be uniform on the surface of a disc with (e.g.) 1km radius around the outbreak centre. 

Despite the fact that an uninformative prior is relatively straightforward to set, it is most likely not advisable in specific applications. Firstly, when an outbreak is suspected, it is typical that information about location is available. On one hand, fruit flies are heavily dependent on the availability of suitable fruit trees for survival and reproduction. Therefore, someone with local area knowledge will be able to determine the most likely locations for an existing population. On the other hand, if an outbreak is known or suspected, then flies must have been detected somewhere. Most likely, the locations of these detections will be known to the analyst. When the fly species has low dispersal distances (as e.g. medfly does) these detection locations are highly informative. Therefore, an informative prior, utilising this information, formally or informally, is recommended.

It is assumed the flies are typically clustered in space. This may be justifiable in practice. For a small, seed population, a population with low density will die out due to the allee effect. However, when this assumption is not realistic, an alternative prior on locations should be considered.

Let $L_c$ be a bivariate random variable describing the centre of the population. Let $L_{i, t}$ be a bivariate random variable describing the location of fly $i$ at time $t$. It seems natural to assume that $\mathrm E (L_{i, t} \mid L_c) = L_c$, for any $(i, t)$. This model assumes that the centre of the population does not move over time. Further, we can specify that $(L_{i, t} \perp \!\!\! \perp  L_{i', t'}) \mid L_c$, for $(i, t) \neq (i', t')$. I.e., conditional on the centre of the population, the fly locations provide no information about each other. This gives the computational advantage that we do not need to track flies locations across time. At each time period, they scatter independently. 

The benefit of these assumptions is priors can be set on the parameters governing $L_c$ and $L_{i, t} \mid L_c$ separately. The prior on $L_{i, t}$ describes the distribution of fly dispersals. Information on this quantity, for a given species, will often be available in scientific literature.

### Probability of capture (likelihood)

Recall from above that the number of captures (and therefore the data vector) at time point $t$ is written as $y_t$, for $t \in \{1, \ldots, T\}$. Recall that it is assumed that the trap locations are each fixed and known with certainty. Then, it is assumed that the probability that fly $i$ is caught in trap $k$ at time $t$ is given by $p_{i, k, t} = p(d_{i, k, t})$ where $d$ is the distance between fly $i$ and trap $k$ at time $t$, and $p(\cdot)$ gives us the probability of capture as a function of distance. Then, the probability that a fly is caught at any trap is simply 
$$
p_{i, t} := 1 - \prod_{k=1}^K(1 - p(d_{i, k, t})).
$$

The probability of capture function $p(\cdot)$ is based on prior analysis of release-recapture data, already discussed, and may be deterministic or random. For example, we might regress captures on distance, from release-recapture data, and allow coefficients to vary randomly. Then, the posteriors would form the priors for the present model.

An intuitive distribution for $y_t$ is the Poisson-binomial distribution. This is the distribution of successes in independent Bernoulli trials with unequal means. 

Note that this model of captures takes for granted the common assumption that there is no interference between traps (see @todocite). This assumption is essentially that the probability that a fly is captured at a given trap is not affected by the presence of other traps. The justification is that $p(\cdot)$ is typically estimated to decrease quickly as a function of distance. This is because traps are generally ineffective as attractants. Therefore, it is typically the case that $p(d_{i, k, t})$ is very small for all but at most one trap. Therefore, the effect of discounting the possibility of being caught there is negligible.

NOTE: Delete the next paragraph?

If the researcher has cause to believe that interference may be non-negligible, a simple correction can be applied. Without loss of generality, suppose we are interested in a single fly in a single trapping period. Let $q_k$ be the probability that that fly is captured at trap $k$, calculated using the distance function above. Let $q_0$ be the probability that the fly is not captured at all. The set $\{q_k\}_{k=0}^K$ are probabilities of exhaustive and mutually exclusive events. Therefore, we can redefine the probabilities of trap-specific capture (or no capture) as $q'_k = q_k / \sum_{i=0}^K q_i$.
