# Introduction

## Control and monitoring of Tephritid fruit flies

Biological (pest) invasions are incursions of incipient populations of plants or animals that are non-native to a given region.^[Note that, for the purpose of this work, the term *population* will be used to mean a group of animals living together in a group. This is to be distinguished from the statistical use of the term.] Such invasions can have high economic significance when the invading species is considered a *pest* (i.e., harmful to human concerns). In the midst of the ongoing globalisation of trade, the salience of biological invasions is increasing around the world. Invasions pose severe economic and environmental risks. On the economic side, they may threaten "wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources" (@mack2000). On the environmental side, they may threaten to disrupt native ecological processes -- e.g. by threatening the extinction of endangered natives, and creating globally homogenous, "cosmopolitan" ecological systems (Ibid.).

Tephritid fruit flies (*Diptera Tephritidae*) are a genus of insects of particularly high economic significance. Species in this genus have the potential to destroy a wide variety of horticultural produce in large amounts. Females lay eggs in plant tissue (often fruits) which is then destroyed in the process of their development. Economic costs of successful fruit fly invasions in Australia have been estimated to be as high as hundreds of millions of dollars (@suckling2016, @hancock2000). Potential costs of Tephritid fruit fly incursions include crop losses; labour and materials associated with eradication and suppression; and knock-on effects to agricultural produce as a consequence of pesticide usage (@suckling2016). 

Some locations in Australia and the USA are internationally recognised exclusion zones for some species of fruit fly. In some of these places *spot infestations* of the relevant fly species can be common (@meats2005). Spot infestations are small invasions, usually met with efforts to eradicate. Eradication methods include spraying of pesticide and release of sterile insects that disrupt the flies' breeding cycle. Currently, it is widespread practice that inference of absence for such invasions is informal. In particular, pest absence is declared according to rules of thumb (Ibid.). These rules are in the form of **zero-catch criteria**. The idea is that, if zero flies are detected for some pre-specified length of time (the zero-catch criterion) we may infer with confidence, and therefore declare, that they have been eradicated from the region (see chapter 2). 

There are issues with the zero-catch criteria currently used. Firstly, they are only minimally sensitive to variability between situations. For example, outbreaks two locations with the same temperatures will have the same zero-catch criteria, even though they may differ in other significant ways. Secondly, they do not explicitly or transparently take into account the low sensitivity of fruit fly traps, which has been the subject of some study (see chapter 2). Thirdly, they are based on a simplified model of fruit fly biology which does not account for variation in development times (both within and between fly populations).

The primary goal of the present work is to develop a rigorous statistical framework for inferring pest absence after a suspected outbreak. The hope is that such a framework can be useful (a) to evaluate existing zero-catch criteria, and (b) to develop improved criteria. A secondary goal of the framework is to provide situation-specific estimates of the probability of eradication. These may be useful to the regulator, who wishes to weigh the cost of eradication probabilistically against the cost of a successful biological invasion.

The method I propose involves spatially explicit, agent based modelling of the relevant fruit fly population. This proposal is inspired by similar recent works using BAyesian models to infer probability of pest absence from real data (see chapter 2).

## Outline of this work

I begin this work in chapter 2 by reviewing relevant literature. In particular, I discuss two bodies of literature. The first is on the existing literature on quantitative analysis of zero-catch criteria for tephritid fruit flies. I explain zero-catch criteria in greater detail, then discuss some ways in which they have been analysed and evaluated in academic literature. The second is on existing Bayesian models for inferring of pest absence. Two example cases from the literature are discussed as inspiration for the model developed in the present work. As far as I know, these are the only such models for this problem (inferring extirpation of a pest population) presented to date. In chapter 3, I develop, and justify, a framework for modelling tephritid fruit fly invasions. Model details are discussed at an abstract level. The focus in this chapter is to present a skeleton of the method. I.e., the basic structure of the model, and core quantitities of interest, are discussed. But the model is not fully specifieed or fit to data. Finally, in chapter 4, I apply the methodology to the specific case of Mediterranean fruit fly, a tephritid species of particularly high economic significance in the USA and Australia. A prior distribution is defined, and inference is performed to evaluate and derive zero-catch criteria for an hypothetical case.
