# Introduction

## Control and monitoring of Tephritid fruit flies

Biological (pest) invasions are incursions of incipient populations of plants or animals that are non-native to a given region. Such invasions can have high economic significance when the invading species is considered a *pest*. In the midst of the ongoing globalisation of trade, the salience of biological invasions is increasing around the world. Invasions are salient because they pose severe economic and environmental risks. On the economic side, they may threaten "wholesale loss of agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources" (@mack2000). On the environmental side, they may threaten to disrupt native ecological processes -- threatening the extinction of endangered natives, and creating globally homogenous, "cosmopolitan" ecological systems (Ibid.).

Tephritid fruit flies (*Diptera Tephritidae*) are a genus of insects of particularly high economic significance. Species in this genus have the potential to destroy a wide variety of horticultural produce, in extremely large amounts. Females lay eggs in plant tissue (often fruits). Eggs develop into larvae, which then feed on surrounding tissue. Economic costs of successful fruit fly invasions in Australia have been estimated to be as high as hundreds of millions of dollars (@suckling2016, @hancock2000). Potential costs of Tephritid fruit fly incursions include crop losses; labour and materials associated with eradication and suppression; knock-on effects to agricultural produce as a consequence of pesticide usage (@suckling2016). 

Some locations in Australia and the USA are internationally recognised exclusion zones for some species of fruit fly. In some of these places *spot infestations* of the relevant fly species can be common (@meats2005). These are small invasions, usually met with relatively small amounts of surveillance and control. Currently, it is widespread practice that inference of absence for such invasions is informal. In particular, pest absence is declared according to rules of thumb (Ibid.). These rules are in the form of **zero-catch criteria**. The idea is that, if zero flies are detected for some pre-specified length of time (the zero-catch criterion) we may infer with confidence, and therefore declare, that they have been eradicated from the region. 

There are issues with the zero-catch criteria currently used. Firstly, they are only minimally sensitive to variability between situations. For example, outbreaks two locations with the same temperatures will have the same zero-catch criteria, even though they may differ in other significant ways. Secondly, they do not explicitly or transparently take into account the low sensitivity of fruit fly traps. Thirdly, they are based on a simplified model of fruit fly biology which does not account for variation.

The primary goal of the present work is to develop a rigorous statistical framework for inferring pest absence after a suspected outbreak. The hope is that such a framework can be useful (a) to evaluate existing zero-catch criteria, and (b) to develop improved methods for deriving such criteria. A secondary goal of the framework is to provide situation-specific estimates of the probability of eradication. These may be useful to the regulator, who wishes to weigh the cost of eradication probabilistically against the cost of a successful biological invasion.

## Outline of this work

I begin this work in chapter two by reviewing relevant literature. In particular, I discuss two bodies of literature. One is on investigation of fruit flies. The second is on existing Bayesian models for inferring of pest absence. Two example cases from the literature are discussed as inspiration for the model developed in the present work. In chapter three, I develop, and justify, a framework for modelling tephritid fruit fly invasions. Model details are discussed at an abstract level. The focus in this chapter is to give a skeleton of the model, assuming that a few sources of information, common in fruit fly literatures, is available to the researcher. Finally, in chapter four, I apply the methodology to the specific case of Mediterranean fruit fly.
