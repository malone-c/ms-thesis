# ms-thesis

This is a Bookdown project including all files for my (Chris Malone's) master's project on Bayesian models for inferring absence of pest species. Chapters are stored in separate numbered Rmd files. A rough outline of the entire thesis is written in the file `index.Rmd`. Finally, the most recently rendered PDF of the entire thesis can be found at [_book/_main.pdf](_book/_main.pdf). I will try to remember to render and push a fresh render of the PDF each time I make a new commit/push.
