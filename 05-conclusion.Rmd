# Conclusion

There are two main contributions of the present work. The first is a novel method for quantitatively studying zero-trap criteria for fruit fly outbreaks. This method is primarily composed of a Bayesian model of fly populations, which jointly models the population size, locations and monitoring process of an incipient population of an invasive fly species. Though simple, and limited in important ways, the model is intuitive, and has parameters which are easily interpreted. The second contribution is an in-depth application of the model to a hypothetical outbreak of Medfly. The case study illustrates use of the method for evaluating zero-catch criteria. 

The results of the case study in chapter 4 have strong policy implications for regulatory decision making in Medfly biosecurity. In this hypothetical scenario, the model finds that the probability of eradication is less than 50% at the time of pest reinstatement, under the existing rule-of-thumb eradication declaration date. Further, the time to 95% probability of eradication is nearly three times later than the rule-of-thumb date. If these results are correct, then using the rule-of-thumb may lead the regulator to mistakenly declare eradication, thus allowing an incipient Medfly to become established at small but stable levels.
